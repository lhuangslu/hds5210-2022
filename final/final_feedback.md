# Feedback on Final

Overall, I think you did a good job with the final project. You set out with clear objectives and followed through on those with your analysis.  I would have liked your analyis, though, to look at factors from across the multiple data sources you pulled in. It felt like you were mostly asking isolated questions from each data file, not combining the data to draw new conclusions as much as I would have liked. To get there, I think there might have needed to be a bit more data cleanup.

One of the requirements for the final project (and a best practice) is to organize your code into functions that can be tested and reused. Your project didn't make any use of functions and didn't provide any validation or testing for transformation logic you used.  (-10 from Modularity and Style)

Your analysis comparing red/blue states would have benefited from some histograms / distribution analysis as well.  Remember that the "mean" does not mean "always".
